Gallerist is a backend web application for car dealership management, built with Java Spring Boot, Hibernate, and Maven, following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern. It prioritizes security and scalability, using JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure authentication and authorization.
A key feature is real-time currency conversion, integrated with the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (TCMB) API, enabling up-to-date exchange rates and multi-currency vehicle sales for accurate and flexible pricing.
Gallerist also adheres to clean code principles, supports RESTful APIs, and is designed to accommodate both small dealerships and large enterprises with modular and extensible architecture.
